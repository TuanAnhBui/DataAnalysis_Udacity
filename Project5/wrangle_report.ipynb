    "\n",
    "1. Which stage of the dogs is the most preferred?\n",
    "2. Which predicted dog'breed have highest rating?\n",
    "3. Which is the most common name?\n",
    "4. Which breed has features that can be predicted with highest confidence?\n",

    "To answer these questions, data is the most important and it will be gathered, assessed and cleaned before doing any analysis and visualization. This report will describe the gather, assess and clean processes."
